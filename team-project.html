									<h2>Project Description</h2>

									<H3>Overview</H3>

									<h4>Topic</h4>
									<p>In this project, our group intends to create a telehealth website that focuses on providing medical services by interacting between a hospital and a patient who isn't even in the exact area via electronic audio and video. Many countries worldwide, including Vietnam, are experiencing congestion and a scarcity of human resources, medical professionals, and medical staff, particularly in light of the rapid development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even at total capacity, it is impossible to handle a significant number of cases in a short period. Overcrowding in large hospitals has been extremely severe in recent years, and this scenario has occurred, is occurring, and will continue to occur, causing public outrage. Due to overpopulation in central hospitals, there are disparities in the quality of medical treatments provided by large and grassroots hospitals, particularly those in rural areas.
										When we prepared this project, we had many goals, outcomes, and essential purposes that we expected when this project came into practice. During this struggling time of the pandemic, the rapid increase in covid-19 cases means that many patients want to go to the hospital to be treated promptly. Since the hospitals are packed, many patients have become critically ill due to doctors and nurses' lack of appropriate treatment. As a result, our projects aim to be one of the most reputable health service platforms focusing on providing medical services and medicines to customers in Vietnam. By choosing to use our services, users can meet doctors as quickly as possible without going to the hospital, and from that, they can easily minimize their social interaction. Furthermore, our business will provide patients with the best and most expedient treatments possible with a team of highly qualified medical specialists on board.
										
									</p>

									<h4>Motivation</h4>
									<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) has crippled health systems in a matter of months and put enormous strain on the physical and psychological elements of millions of people’s lives all across the world, including in Vietnam. Our country has been suffering from a severe scarcity of medical workers and medical equipment during these challenging times. To prevent the disease from spreading quickly, the government has imposed a maximum restriction on going out for all citizens to reduce person-to-person contact. People with suspected COVID-19 symptoms or outpatients in need of medical attention are debating whether or not to go to the hospital in person. They were instructed to contact a health adviser at the hospital via telephone for early direction and service referral under aggressive social distancing, but all hotlines to contact the hospital are either busy or unable to be accessed due to the high volume of callers.
										To assist hospitals, clinics, and doctors in dealing with the social distancing measures put in place to help flatten the COVID-19 infection curve, telehealth became a saving grace at the height of the pandemic in search of a way to provide the same quality of care services while minimizing the spread of the coronavirus. Critical trends in the utilization of technology have evolved, which will continue to impact the future of telehealth services.
										According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), telehealth utilization increased by more than 154% in late March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Furthermore, according to current Fortune Business Insight forecasts, the market will be worth more than $397 billion by 2027. To demonstrate the pandemic’s impact on the industry, the market was only worth $42 billion in 2019.
										Telemedicine was initially introduced in Vietnam in 1998. Still, due to a lack of contextualized strategies, financial and human resources, legal and infrastructure, and a culture of absorbing new technology in health, it has yet to fully integrate into the Vietnamese health system. This is an opportunity for the hospital to develop their system to a new level of service since the demand for online medical assessment has boosted. Furthermore, website developers in positions such as Front-end, Back-end, or Full-stack are currently the most common employment in Vietnam’s IT business. The high demand for these positions is one of the chances for us to recruit and collaborate with quality web developers from the positions specified to achieve our goal: creating a user-friendly website to allow the majority of customers to use our service. Another IT trend that has been remarkable in recent years is artificial intelligence. It is stated by Rahul Vershneya that “The importance of AI in telehealth will expand significantly as the area of telemedicine and telehealth develops with more acceptance. The use of artificial intelligence in telehealth may be very beneficial to medical practitioners. It will help reduce expenses, provide better healthcare to people, and improve the work environment by decreasing patient wait times, recommending the best treatment choices, and, most significantly, making healthcare accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” We believe this is an excellent opportunity to apply AI technology to our products. By collecting and processing a database of patient records, we can then teach the AI ​​how to help patients with similar illnesses.
										Indeed, these IT trends would benefit us in applying various IT technologies and recruiting for this project. Our future employees will be able to keep up with the latest IT developments and learn how to collaborate with other institutions with other vocations and marketing and researching abilities to identify quality ingredient sources at the most reasonable price. This project also allows us to demonstrate our research and coding abilities by creating a prototype website for our idea.
										</p>

									<h4>Landscape</h4>
									<p>Although telehealth is becoming increasingly popular around the world, there is still a lack of software to facilitate remote medical examinations in Vietnam. As a result, we will compare our project against similar services accessible worldwide. These days, many companies are working on telehealth in the market, such as Cerebral, MeMD, Teladoc, etc. They have distinct advantages over each other and us. Consider Cerebral, which focuses on providing treatment for a variety of mental health conditions, including:
									<br>	·         Anxiety
									<br>	·         Depression
									<br>	·         Insomnia
									<br>	·         Bipolar disorder
									<br>	They also provide talk therapy and medication management. They are our primary rival for this project. They have been in the company for a long time and have varying experience levels in this sector. However, variations in our project might be advantageous to us. Firstly, our project provides users with a wide range of medical assessment alternatives beyond simply addressing mental illness. The second point is that our service makes use of powerful AI technology, which improves the quality of our products and services. Artificial intelligence will ask the patient a series of questions about the patient's condition and, based on the answers to those survey questions, will provide the patient with a diagnosis. If the A.I cannot give the correct response; the patient will be transported directly to a highly qualified medical specialist for assessment. We feel that our distinctions will help us differentiate ourselves from our competition, target a more niche audience, and ultimately increase our business.

									<H3>Detailed description</H3>
									
									<h4>Aims</h4>
									<p>Our main aim for this project is to create a website, which provides the best treatments for patients wherever they stay. We comprehend the difficult medical situations due to the pandemic and the healthcare in the rural areas, which is even worse in the outbreak of the epidemic. Until now, COVID-19 has caused millions of death tolls, and it is not only patients but the medical staff. Moreover, healthcare in rural areas is also underrated because of the shortage of healthcare workers and the lack of medical resources. To provide the most useful and comfortable product for the users, we think it must be able to reduce as much interactive treatment as it could, it also should be easy to use and our final result might also push the process of treatment to reduce the time-consuming while ensuring the best quality.
										With the first goal, reducing the interactive treatment, we hope that medical staff could stay in their place and cure the patients. In this pandemic, the Coronavirus is transmitted by face-to-face communication, so the transmission is extremely quick and unrecognizable, moreover, the symptoms are likely the same as the normal fever. Therefore, patients might not know they have COVID-19, and the physical treatments accidentally increase the infection. Moreover, many people refuse to visit the doctors when they are sick, because of the pandemic. For those reasons, our product could help medical staff virtually diagnose the disease and in case it is easy to infect, the medical locations and patients could have the best preparation to avoid an outbreak of diseases.
										Secondly, the simplicity of this product, the consumers could use and understand it effortlessly. The disparity in healthcare between urban and rural areas is mainly caused by the lack of health workers in remote regions. Our project will be a bridge between the doctors and the patients, therefore, the websites will focus on some priorities such as making an appointment, emergency help from the nearest medical center, etc, and it should be a user-friendly website.
										The final goal is that the website also could reduce the time-consuming, which means the process of cure should be shortened in terms of ensuring the medical quality. Due to the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases, most hospitals, medical centers, clinics, etc, are out of control, and many patients have to wait days to visit the doctors. Our project plans to shorten some unnecessary steps and when the appointment is over, the medicine will be shipped to the patients’ address.
										</p>
								
									<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
									<p>The basic steps of all projects are forming or finding a group, choosing the topic, dividing the tasks for each member, checking each others’ work, and finally, reviewing everything before submitting the best product. It might sound easy and smooth to reach the final award, but the plan is just on paper, things might change so much when we get to work.
									<br><b> The beginning of us</b> 
									<br>The email sent by Doan Nhat Nam Anh was sent to all students, and the four earliest people, who are Bao, Duong, Nam, and Chi, who replied to his email became the eleventh group. The fifth member joined the group chat on March 8th, and from that day, we officially became a group. In the first week of April, we returned to face-to-face class, so we decided to work on the first part, which is choosing the topic. In the first place, Phuong Nam suggested the “Telehealth” idea, because this topic is pretty interesting and no limitation is mentioned in the requirement of the topic, we agreed right away. However, this is just a small discussion on Messenger, so we decided to have another meeting to make the final decision, and on the same day, our template, which everyone could edit, was created by Di Bao on Google Docs. The template helps us know what our final report might look like and review other members’ work more conveniently. Because of the personal development week, we decided to work on some personal parts such as Team Profile first. When the personal development ended, our first face-to-face meeting was organized on April 21st, and we came up with a new idea, which was about Human Resource technology. It might help the employers hire employees, while it also helps the employees create an efficient CV and find their jobs. This topic is interesting and attractive to most of us since it could introduce to everyone more job opportunities, and we might need it in the future. However, it is not new to Vietnamese as TopCV or LinkedIn is pretty familiar to the young, while the “Telehealth” idea is more unique, and due to the epidemic, the healthcare topic is more and more crucial. Therefore, after that meeting, we concluded and began this group project with “Telehealth”. We spent about two days preparing and doing some research about it, then we were allocated suitable tasks depending on our ability and passion on April 24th.
									<br>
									</p>

									<h4>Roles</h4>
									<p>We’re afraid that it won’t be easy to clarify a unique and distinct role for each individual as everyone took part in almost everything. For everyone to improve and gain more knowledge, we decided that it would be best if everyone could contribute to every little aspect of the project. But of course, there will definitely be the main contributor to a particular section and some main roles as everyone is unique, hence they will have different abilities and strengths. When it comes to the coordinator, bao is the one that communicates to every member publicly and privately to ensure the stability of the project. Nam Anh, Phuong Nam, and Chi are the core innovators of the project, most of the ideas and functionality, business perspectives, etc… come from them. Duong is the one that will develop and improvise those ideas to the fullest. Everyone in this team doesn’t just do what they’re assigned to do, they’re knowledge seekers, and they support and contribute to each other’s work willingly. 
									</p>

									<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
									<p></p>

									<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
									<p><br> Visual Studio Code: The platform to write HTML, SCSS, CSS and Javascript to code the web
										<br> HTML: Build the outline of the website
										<br> SCSS,CSS: Designing the web, making it become more attractive.
										<br> JavaScript: Create the movement and animation of the website.
										<br> PowerPoint: Provide slides for the presentation.
										<br> To develop this project, we are using VScode to code the HTML, SCSS, CSS and JavaScript to finish our assignment, website and project.In the coding session, Trong Duong have learned HTML and CSS before so that he had do the coding part. However, all four other members also contributed to the content of the website. We are able to see and add information that a website needed during the formation of the web. Five of us have worked hard to finish the report. Last but not least, everyone in our group except for Trong Duong has done the powerpoint to prepare for the presentation as Trong Duong has been building the web.
										</p>

									<h4>Testing</h4>
									<p>Testing is a crucial component of the design process. People frequently overlook or skimp on the testing portion. Before making something public, it must be tested for flaws, usability, security, and functionality. There are many different types of tests that must be conducted when it comes to testing:
										<br>
										<br><b>Cross Browser Testing</b> 
										<br> Cross Browser Testing is a crucial test to be performed on our website. This is a test to determine if our web application will run smoothly as expected on several different browsers. We need to make sure font sizes, page alignment, image sizes and animation appear normally on every popular browser like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc. In order to test this, we can use a testing framework called Selenium, according to guru99, “Selenium is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing.”[5] As we aim to provide services for patients from a variety of backgrounds, having a functional, accessible website for everyone is a must.
										<br>
										<br><b>Functionality testing</b> 
										<br> Another vital test to be conducted for the website is functionality testing. The goal of our group is to test each function of the software program by giving adequate input and comparing the output to the functional requirements. Our testing examines the UI, API, Security, and other features. Testing can be performed manually or automatically.
										<br>
										<br><b>Usability testing</b> 
										<br> Also known as User Experience (UX) testing, this test determines how simple and user-friendly our website is. Usability testing primarily focuses on the application's simplicity of use, flexibility in handling controls, and capacity to accomplish its objectives. We let some of our friends, relatives and family members closely examine the website and in response, give us feedback for improvements. Aesthetics and design is what helps new customers to understand and give them indication on what to do next, and the more user-friendly it is we’re giving , the more engagement we will get.
										<br>
										<br><b>Security testing</b> 
										<br> Because our website will be storing consumer and patient sensitive information and credentials, it is critical that we maintain the highest level of website security. The risk of a data breach or any types of cyber-attack should be kept to a minimum. There's a lot of testing when it comes to web application security, the risks which need to be strictly examined include password cracking, URL manipulating, SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, according to testbytes [6]. To minimize the workload and human resources, we can use some open-source security testing tools like NetSparker, ImmuniWeb, Vega, Wapiti, and many others based on Cigniti[7].
										<br>
										<br><b>Database testing</b> 
										<br> As our project aims to build a health information technology website, it is necessary for us to perform regular evaluation and testing to determine if our schema, tables and data for consistency and quality. The importance of database testing is clearly stated in guru99 “Database testing helps to save data loss, saves aborted transaction data and no unauthorized access to the information.”[8] There are numerous open-source database testing tools we can make use of, this include Database Benchmark, Database rider, DBfit, dbstress etc.
										</p>

									<h4>Risk</h4>
									<p>Every project, from small to large scale will have a risk factor in the play, and our project is not excluded from this. There are many risk factors surrounding our project that can be identified, some are generic and some are specific, but we will only go into the specific one that heavily influences our project running. 
										<br> Since our project is to be catered to the masses, there will be a risk of the interface design lacking accessibility options, unable to deliver the products to different user groups or overall failing to be a good UI. If the interface is hard or cannot be understood by people then our project will likely fail to serve its original purpose.
										<br> Our project will be hosted on the web but it has to be hosted physically somewhere, so there is risk surrounding this topic. A common risk we might encounter is bad hosting or unsecure hosting. Because our project will be targeting the majority at 24/7, it is necessary to have a dedicated server working and the page must be up all the time. There is always a risk of our website getting a DDOS attack, hacked or leaking information out by hacker or rebellious individual, even on the most premium and protected server hosting and cyber security. Therefore, it is very vital that our team must work on the server hosting and protection of our project if we want to keep the website working properly in the future. Bad hosting will also give us difficulty in running the website, so it is wise that we must go through a detailed selection process when choosing a hosting provider.
										<br> Not only the DDOS attack, we can also face the server down if it is overloaded. Due to some technical problem, websites go down because of overload sometimes happens in Vietnamese networks which leads to the inconvenience for the customer when using the web and app. Moreover, when there is too much access to the web, it also causes internal breakdown. We are working very hard to avoid this problem happening in the future. 
										<br> Throughout the whole time working with the team members from my groups, I found out that everyone is very ambitious and enthusiastic. Since everyone is very ambitious and the project is very flexible and dynamic, team members might want to change or add new scope on the go. Scope creep can be very risky for a team project as it will disrupt the development process currently on going, thus might result in a late deadline for the project final products.
										<br> On the business side, there will be many risks involved in the launching, funding and demonstrating of the final products. The commonly occurring risk a project often faces is the lack of investor or no investor interested in the project. Having a great idea for a project is good but it has to be able to adapt to the needs of the masses and appeal to the business industry. If a project idea might look too far fetched in terms of the business side, investors will most likely skip it without going into details. Getting investors to invest in a business is only the first step, a project needs to be able to utilize the given capital to launch the products successfully, else it will fail. This requires the project to be deliverable with the current given capital, therefore creating a risk of the lack of funding for the project, which is another huge risk factor in creating successful products.
										<br> Furthermore, as Vietnamese hate hospitals and health checking, we have to prepare for the situation that the access of our customers will not reach our expectation at least 6 months after we started the business. In terms of competitors, although telehealth is not very popular in Vietnam, online diagnosis is not a really profitable project as it does not provide enough trust for the customers. Next, our target customers are the people who are familiar with technology; nevertheless, the fact that the Vietnamese people who get familiar with technology do not reach our expectations. The project can be predicted to witness a loss at the beginning but we believe that more and more people will care about telehealth as IT will be a crucial part of the future world. 
										</p>
									
									<h4>Group processess and communication</h4>
									<p>Communication is a vital part of every project. Effective communication will directly affect the efficiency of every member of a group project, thus ensuring the project is moving at a good pace. Keeping team members well informed on a project will also ensure that everyone is on the same page. Because not everyone can be available at school all the time, we moved the majority of our communication to digital means to ensure better communication.
										<br> Because team members' performance will affect the whole team, if one member or more does not respond to communications and not keeping in check with the team, our project pacing will be affected heavily, thus can result in our failure. Every member must hold each other. If a member does not respond, we will first try to message him/her, or if we have a tutorial that day, we will meet him/her face-to-face and ask him/her why he/she does not respond to us. If those members fail to respond to our message, we will call them and ask them what problem is preventing them from working and responding to our communication.
