									<h2>Team introduction</h2>

									<h3>Nam Nguyen - s3941773</h3>
									<p>My name is Nam Nguyen. I was born and raised in Hanoi - the capital city of Vietnam. Currently, I am in the 1st semester at RMIT university, majoring in Information Technology. I have a huge passion for sport, especially football. My favorite football team is Manchester United, a well-known English club around the world. Apart from football, I am also a huge enthusiast of IoT, which is why I am enrolled in RMIT’s IT program. I still remember that when I was young, my father bought me a personal computer and he taught me so many things about computers and technology. This is when I understood how much I loved computers and everything that operates on them. In general, that was the beginning of my interest in technology, after which I began researching, learning and practicing some basic programming languages through Youtube videos and W3school. Since then, I have always had a dream of becoming a software engineer working for a big tech company such as Google, Facebook, etc. Regarding IT experiences, I am currently working as a software engineer at FPT corporation, however, I still want to expand my knowledge and skills that are required in this industry. I hope in the near future, I will be able to be more successful in this field.

									<h3>Trong Duong - s3926135</h3>
									<p>I was born and raised in Hanoi, as the first child of my family. Up to this moment, I'm currently studying in RMIT Vietnam in IT major as a freshman. Since my childhood, my father has been exposing me to technology. I was able to get my hands on a computer, and a digital camera, and I grew a passion and interest in those technology pieces. In my free time, I often enjoyed listening to music while working out in the gym and playing games with my friend to relieve stress. As a hobby, I was very invested in filmmaking, and I took every opportunity that arose to further improve my learning curves, and I often signed up for any available competition locally in my area with my friends to satisfy our craving for creating cinematography pieces. Being exposed and interested in the tech-world, I was a tech enthusiast. I self-taught myself about every technical aspect of PC hardware, and assembled my own PC myself through trial and error. Recently, after enrolling in RMIT, I discovered and learned more about the IT industries, and I was slowly growing my interest in coding. I learned and researched some basic coding languages such as HTML and Python to help with my study, and from there, I was feeling an attraction to become a backend developer in the future. As a newbie and freshman, my IT experience is lacking but I am eager to learn to improve myself, extend my knowledge and hone my skill.</p>

									<h3>Chi Ha - s3930417</h3>
									<p>My name is Ha, Thuy Chi. I was born in Bac Ninh, my mom’s hometown, and due to my parents’ career, they moved houses a lot, so I have spent my life in different areas of Vietnam, but now my family lives in Thanh Hoa. My hobbies are watching anime and playing games with my best friend. We usually play Genshin Impact together, and most of the time is walking around and talking about our day or sharing some abstract ideas, since I went back to Vietnam while she was still in Canada. I am also attracted by the ideas and information about philosophy since I learned Philosophy in grade 11 but most people have no passion about those aspects. To be honest, I chose this major due to my parents’ desire at that moment, and I also didn’t have any interest in any other major or job. However, like some people, the moment that the turtle drew a beautiful star on Python really lit a little fire in my heart, it is same as you suddenly find the solution for a hard question after hours of thinking, and then those feelings keep me moving forward, as well as, the idea that we can change the future of humanity through technology is attractive and persuasive to a young soul. Since I only finished Introduction to Programming in the previous semester, I still have a lot of knowledge to absorb in the future.

									<h3>Nam Anh - s3877209</h3>
									<p>My name is Doan Nhat Nam Anh. I was born in Hai Duong but I spent my childhood in Bac Giang where me and my family currently live. This is my fifth semester at RMIT and my major is Logistic and supply chain management. Although I am not majoring in IT, I believe that IT will be an extremely crucial part in the future world. I often spend my free time playing video games, watching movies, reading novels and playing football. I have joined the RMIT football club and the club has helped me a lot in improving my skills. I love reading sci-fi novels about the future world where technology dominates the world. That is one of the reasons that I am interested in this course to make sure that no machine can dominate our future world. Moreover, I love to play video games especially games in the Virtual world because they make me feel that I am actually experiencing the world inside the game. Hence, I am really into this part of the IT industry that I spend hours reading news about it every day. I hope in the future, VR technology will become much more popular to everyone so that people can enjoy it in the most comfortable way. What I want to get from this course is the term “future”. This is an extremely important term to young people like me to catch up with globalization. Hence, I hope I can get as much information as I need to have a good preparation for my future career.</p>
								
									<h3>Bao Nguyen - s3927524</h3>
									<p>My name is Nguyen Tat Di Bao. This is my first ever year studying at RMIT, and it takes quite a story to tell when it comes to my decision on majoring in IT. To be honest, IT wasn’t my interest and pure passion during my high school years. I’ve never had the thought of pursuing it because I had an ambitious career as a singer and songwriter. I have always adored music, it’s what brings people together, it’s the emotions, arts of mankind that’s conveyed through beats and rhythms. Singing and performing in a band was my hobby and my dream job. I occasionally think of the future where I could perform on a big stage in front of crowds that know who I am and appreciate the arts within me. But I guess not every story will have a happy ending, maybe those years of singing, performing on stage at high school was just a sudden interest, a perfume of youth that won’t last long. I need to be more serious and realistic when it comes to choosing my career path. I took a semester to concentrate on what’s suitable for my future, what path I’ll be taking? I started to realize that maybe this pandemic wasn’t so bad after all and this was the time I needed to readjust, focus more on my career, and make the right educational path. I took a few classes online after graduating high school and it felt like something had changed. A part of me starts to like coding a bit after a few months of practicing python, C++, and java. But it’s not only the coding part that made me interested and motivated me on leaning toward IT, it’s the possibilities, the ideas that start running and pumping through my mind on what the world could be and what I can do if I just continue learning and practicing it for another few years. My dad, who’s also working in Tech industries, encouraged me to study IT because he knows that he could provide me with some assistance, and it would be a huge beneficial decision to make in the long run. I have always been so fascinated by the idea of AI and VR technologies through books, anime, and Sci-fi movies. It's great to imagine that one day, our real-life would be closer and closer to the expectation of those films if people like me just started contributing.</p>
