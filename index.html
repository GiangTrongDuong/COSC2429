									<h2>What is HITMAN?</h2>
									<p>HITMAN stand for Health Information Technology Management And Nursing. We are a telehealth organisation specialize in online nursing and diagonising.</p>

									<h2>What is telehealth?</h2>

									<p>Telehealth — sometimes called telemedicine — lets your doctor provide care for you without an in-person office visit. Telehealth is done primarily online with internet access on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.
										<br>
										<br> There are several options for telehealth care:
										<br>
										<br>1. Talk to your doctor live over the phone or video chat.
										<br>2. Send and receive messages from your doctor using secure messaging, email, secure messaging, and secure file exchange.
										<br>3. Use remote monitoring so your doctor can check on you at home. For example, you might use a device to gather vital signs or other vitals to help your doctor stay informed on your progress.
									</p>

									<h2>Why do we need telehealth?</h2>

									<p>Virtual visits are growing in popularity. Though in-person office visits may be necessary in certain cases, there are many benefits of telehealth care.
										<br>
										<br>1. Limited physical contact reduces everyone’s exposure to COVID-19
										<br>2. Virtual visits ensure you get health care wherever you are located – at home, at work or even in your car
										<br>3. Virtual visits cut down on travel, time off from work, and the need for child care
										<br>4. Virtual health care tools can shorten the wait for an appointment
										<br>5. Increased access to specialists who are located far away from your hometown
										<br>6. Telehealth is not a perfect fit for everyone or every medical condition. Make sure you discuss any disadvantages or risks with your doctor.</p>

											<h2>Telehealth and COVID-19</h2>
											<p>It is extremely important that you self-isolate if you think you may have COVID-19 or have been exposed. That means staying home from work or school and distancing yourself from friends and family, even the people who live in your home.

												Follow these steps to get the care you need.</p>
											<h3>Start by using a COVID-19 self-assessment tool
											</h3>
											<p>Use an online COVID-19 self-assessment tool before you contact your doctor. This protects everyone’s health and safety and reduces the burden on our health care system.

												<br>This self-assessment tool was developed based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
												
												<br>A self-assessment tool will ask you a few questions about:
												
												<br>1. Symptoms you have
												
												<br>2. Whether you have been in close physical contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19
												
												<br>3. Whether you live in a community where many people have been diagnosed with COVID-19
												
												<br>4. Any medical conditions that put you at high risk for complications if you get COVID-19</p>

											<h3>Telehealth options</h3>
											<p>Many doctors now provide telehealth services. Contact your doctor or health insurance to ask about your options.

												<br>There are also health centers and on-demand telehealth services available to everyone, including people who do not have health insurance.</p>
											
											<h3>Before an online session with doctor</h3>
											<p>Your doctor will need several important pieces of information when you schedule a telehealth visit to discuss COVID-19. Consider writing down this information before your virtual visit:

											
												<br><b><i>Your symptoms</i></b>— What are they and when they started
												<br><b><i>Your health</i></b> — Any other health conditions you have and how you have been managing them during the pandemic
												<br><b><i>Exposure to COVID-19</i></b> — If you have definitely been exposed, how, and when
												<br><b><i>Your questions</i></b> — If there is anything specific you want to know about your health or the health of other people in your home</p>
